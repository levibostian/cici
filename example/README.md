# Example

This directory exists to act as an example project to test out `cici` on. Given time and more practice with Ruby, this project will be replaced with a test suite ðŸ˜ƒ. 

# Getting started 

```
cd example/
```

* Build and install the gem

```
bundle exec rake build; gem install cici-*.gem
```

* Now, you're ready to test against the example. 

```
cd example/
cici -v
```
